# TouchBarSpotify
A MacOS Touch Bar app to easily access my favorite Spotify playlists. With the touch of a button on my touch bar, my go-to playlist starts playing.

<b>Button Descriptions</b><ul>
<li>The green Spotify logo button opens the Spotify desktop app. That's it. 
<li>The pink-gradient Spotify logo button opens my chill lo-fi playlist, which also happens to be my Daily Mix 2. Spotify changes this playlist every week, so it is a dynamic playlist. 
<li>The infinity-symbol button opens my On-Repeat playlist. This one is also dynamic.
<li>The BTS button opens (you guessed it) a playlist that has the entire BTS discography. This keeps getting updated as new songs release.
<li>The last white button opens a podcast I listen to regularly called No New Notifications. 
</ul>


Note: I have customized this app to my personal Spotify preferences, but I've written the source code in a way that makes changing it to suit your own preferences a simple task!
